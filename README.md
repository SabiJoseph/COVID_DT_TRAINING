#Key Insights:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data and created new features like Case Fatality and Recovery Rates.

Modeling: Gained experience with Decision Trees and hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using MSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Overfitting Detection: Learned to spot overfitting and the need for cross-validation.

Visualization: Interpreted model results through SHAP and feature importance plots.

#Assessment:

#First Data Set :

The model achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 1.00 for both classes. While this indicates excellent performance, such perfect results can be a sign of overfitting, especially if the model performs similarly on training data.
Fruther verify the model's robustness through cross-validation or a separate validation set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

#Second Data Set :
The decision tree model, after initial training, showed an MSE of 72,751,494.55, MAE of 2,124.75, and an R-squared of 0.99, while the tuned model achieved a significant improvement with an MSE of 4,291,893.86, MAE of 223.47, and R-squared of 0.9994; compared to other models, the Random Forest yielded an MSE of 8,035,735.11 and R-squared of 0.9988, and the Gradient Boosting model had an MSE of 13,163,640.07 and R-squared of 0.9981.
Compared its performance with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, with the decision tree outperforming both in terms of prediction accuracy.
